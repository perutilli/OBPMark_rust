# OBPMARK rust benchmarks
A collection of crates for benchmarking bare metal and hosted embedded systems.  
The workspace is NOT intended to be built as one, rather you should build the crate that you need for your target, i.e. benchmarks for hosted enviroments and bare_metal otherwise (at the moment it supports exclusively risv64gc targets).

OBPMark benchmarks ported to Rust
