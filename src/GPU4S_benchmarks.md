## General notes
Remember to use the `--release` flag when compiling the benchmarks if testing the performance!!!

There exist blas and lapack ports to rust (https://github.com/stainless-steel/blas, https://github.com/stainless-steel/lapack), however they are autogenerated and all the calls are unsafe (which might not be fixable).  
While this is likely not a problem since this libraries have existed for decades, this might go against the idea of having a safe language, making them, in my opinion, not suitable for this benchmark.  
These are some probably more suitable alternatives:
* nalgebra: Linear algebra library (https://www.nalgebra.org/docs/)
* ndarray: provides an N-dimensional container for general elements and for numerics. (https://docs.rs/ndarray)
* rulinalg a linear algebra library written in Rust that doesnâ€™t require heavy external dependencies. (https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg/) -> apparently not maintained anymore 
 
Is this even the direction we want to go? I think we might want to implement this ourselves, in which case though we should probably have this be a separate library, so that the code is usable not exclusively for this benchmark.
