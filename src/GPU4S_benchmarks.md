## Problems
* [ ] The RNG for floats generates numbers between 0 and 1 
* [x] Do the same for 1d to sanity check the indexing
* [ ] Fix formatting problems for integers
* [ ] Why are integers not overflowing even without the modulo?
* [x] Note that the random_seed gives the same result ONLY on the same machine
* [ ] Think of potential verification function where it takes the closures to execute to get the expected result, so that verification could be one line.
* [ ] Probably we want a trait for Matrix, so that we are sure that some functions have a certain signature, this is not strictly necessary since at compilation time we know which matrix type we are using (which is also good for performance), however it would be nice to have.

### Ndarray correcteness
As (maybe) expected, the ndarray fails verification for float and double. However sometimes it does pass using epsilon of 1e-4 (same used in the original benchmark). Why does this happen?  
Also how come it is so fast -> Quite sure it uses BLAS or something similar, we need to be sure of this.   
<mark> I think we might want to abandon ndarray at least for the moment</mark>, it might not be mantained anymore. I do want to come back to it, but it seems a bit too opaque of a package. 

## Input (and output) files format
The input files are in hexadecimal format. Each line contains an hexadecimal number. The output files are in the same format.
To read the matrix from the file, use function `get_double_hexadecimal_values`, that gets two bytes (characters 0-9,A-F) at a time into a temp vector and converts them to an integer value, which will be a byte in the number we are reading. This should be easy to do in rust, thanks to  `f32::from_bytes` and `f64::from_bytes`. However a consideration about endianess and type (i32, f32 or f64) should be made.

## Standardizing arguments

### Common arguments
List of all common arguments for all benchmarks, and ones that could be common if not already present:
* size (-s, --size): size of matrix or matrices (this can be common for the current implementations since they are all square matrices and if there are 2 they are the same size)
* export (-e, --export): export the results of the output in hexadecimal format (right now it says also verification, for the moment I would leave that out) (this would be -g at the moment)
* verify (-v, --verify): verify the output against the reference cpu implementation (for now it will be against the Rust's 2d vector implementation, later we might want this to be against the original C implementation)
* NOT CONSIDERED -g: not considered at the moment
* output (-o, --output): print the results to stdout in a human readable format that is not suitable for verification (hence it is probably fine to keep it for stdout)
* timing (-t, --timing): print the timing of the execution: in the gpu version there are 3 times (copy to gpu, kernel execution, copy back to cpu), for now we only have one
* NOT CONSIDERED -c, -C: having only one time, this does not seem useful
* input (-i, --input): pass input data and the result and compares (using the hex format)
* NOT RELEVANT -d: not relevant for cpu benchmarks
* help (-h, --help): print help information, taken care of by clap
We can put this in a clap struct in a module "benchmark_utils" or something like that, and then we can import it in all the benchmarks.  
Then we should think about a macro or something that will take care of the common arguments (this might be a bit tricky, leaving it for later)

## General notes
<mark>Remember to use the `--release` flag when compiling the benchmarks if testing the performance!!!</mark>

Cargo features are not supposed to be used the way we are using them, however there does not seem to be a straight forward way to achieve the same functionality. The question is whether we care enough about the size of the binary to keep using conditional compilation (in this "wrong" way, we would enforce proper features values like so https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/mutually-exclusive-feature-flags/8601) or if we can just deal with this stuff with clap.  
I believe that we do care about the size of the binary, given that the code will run on embedded devices.

There exist blas and lapack ports to rust (https://github.com/stainless-steel/blas, https://github.com/stainless-steel/lapack), however they are autogenerated and all the calls are unsafe (which might not be fixable).  
While this is likely not a problem since this libraries have existed for decades, this might go against the idea of having a safe language, making them, in my opinion, not suitable for this benchmark.  
These are some probably more suitable alternatives:
* nalgebra: Linear algebra library (https://www.nalgebra.org/docs/)
* ndarray: provides an N-dimensional container for general elements and for numerics. (https://docs.rs/ndarray)
* rulinalg a linear algebra library written in Rust that doesn’t require heavy external dependencies. (https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg/) -> apparently not maintained anymore 
 
Is this even the direction we want to go? I think we might want to implement this ourselves, in which case though we should probably have this be a separate library, so that the code is usable not exclusively for this benchmark.

How can I check correctness??

Our structure could be the following:

`lib.rs`
```rust
mod matrix_1d;
mod matrix_2d;
mod matrix_ndarray;

// error enum definition

trait MatMul {
    fn mat_mul(&self, other: &Self, res: &mut Self) -> Result<(), Error>;
}
```

`matrix_1d.rs`
```rust
pub struct Matrix {
    data: Vec<Number>,
    rows: usize,
    cols: usize,
}

impl MatMul for Matrix {
    fn mat_mul(&self, other: &Self, res: &mut Self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // do stuff
    }
}
```

`matrix_2d.rs`
```rust
pub struct Matrix {
    data: Vec<Vec<Number>>,
    rows: usize,
    cols: usize,
}
```

`main.rs`
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "matrix_1d")]
use matrix_1d::Matrix;
#[cfg(feature = "matrix_2d")]
use matrix_2d::Matrix;
#[cfg(feature = "matrix_ndarray")]
use matrix_ndarray::Matrix;

```
I think it should check all the boxes:  
- [x] straight forward and localized conditional compilation
- [x] binary size should be the same as if we had a single implementation
- [x] completely transparent to the main function, it only has to use the `Matrix` type
- [x] each benchmark defines a new trait and implements it for the various matrix types
